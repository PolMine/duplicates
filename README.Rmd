## About 

The package implements a procedure described by Fritz Kliche, Andre Blessing,
Urlich Heid and Jonathan Sonntag in the paper "The eIdentity Text
ExplorationWorkbench" presented at LREC 2014
(see \url{http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/332_Paper.pdf}).
The main function is `detect_duplicates()`.


## Related work

Near duplicate detection is a standard NLP task. There is a wide range of
algorithms that are used for near duplicate detection and there is a broad set
of implementations in the programming languages used for NLP tasks.

In the R context, the [textreuse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textreuse)
package is the point of reference for duplicate detection. The use case for the
*duplicates* package is large corpora that have been indexed with the Corpus
Workbench (CWB). The hashing step which is a selling point for the textreuse
package is performed already, and requirements for tokenizing and hashing the
data are not replicated. The scenario for using the duplicates package is 
large, CWB-indexed corpora.
