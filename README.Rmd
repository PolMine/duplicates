## About 

The package implements a procedure described by Fritz Kliche, Andre Blessing,
Urlich Heid and Jonathan Sonntag in the paper "The eIdentity Text
ExplorationWorkbench" presented at LREC 2014
(see \url{http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/332_Paper.pdf}).
The main function is `detect_duplicates()`.
